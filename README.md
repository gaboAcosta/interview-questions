# Interview Questions

In this repository, I am documenting the questions I am solving in multiple places like leetcode, hackerrank or algoexpert.io

I am also adding questions I get in interviews and that I can't solve, so that I can learn them and do better next time

The solved algorythms are in the solved folder, there are scripts to run solved or unsolved

``npm run test`` will run the tests against the solved folder, this is used in the github action setup to this project

``npm run test:watch`` will run the tests against the solved folder and watch for changes

``npm run test:unsolved`` will run the tests against the unsolved folder

``npm run test:unsolved:watch`` will run the tests against the unsolved folder and watch for changes
